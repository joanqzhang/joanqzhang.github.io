**HKUST Geobiology Group** was estabilished in 2022. We are interested in understanding the interactions of biosphere and the geosphere. Particularly, we now have a strong focus on trace metal biogeochemstry. We use laboratory measurements and quantitative models to understand a range of processes governing trace metal distribution and isotope ratios in various biological and environmental systems. 

Our group has access to the following key facilities:
**Incubators**: several light incubators that are dedicated to the team for culturing experiments.
**Trace-metal-free laminar flow cabinets**: one polycarbonate made laminar flow biological safety hood that is dedicated to trace-metal-free biological work and a polycarbonate made laminar flow extraction hood that is specifically for sample preparation (e.g., cell digestion) for trace metal analysis.
**Acid-purification system**: two DST-4000 acid purification systems to produce high-purity acids for cleaning plasticware, sample digestion, and trace metal analysis.
**Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)**: a new NEXION 5000 ICP-MS coupled with single cell introduction system for analysing the metallomes of phytoplankton.
**Cleansuite** and **MC-ICP-MS** for trace metal stable isotope analysis (available in 2024).
Other necessary facilities available in HKUST: EMs, coulter counter, multi-mode plate reader, Phyto-PAM, CHN Elemental Analyser, facilities for proteomic analysis, and High Performance Computing Cluster.
