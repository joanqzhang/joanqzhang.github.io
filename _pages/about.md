This is markdown file (md) that you can easily edit your webpage

A few tips for you to get started: 

1. You can insert links directing to other papges such as [this one :)](https://jiyingli.github.io) 

2. Using "=====" will create a headline, e.g., 

Head 1 
====== 

3.Using '-----' creates a secondary headline, e.g., 

Head 2 
------

4. You can also use '**' to make it bold, e.g, 

**This one**

5. and '*' to italic the text, e.g., 

*This one*

There is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _research, _teaching, or _news. 
For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). 
At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks.

You can also use '**' to make it bold, and '*' to italic the text
