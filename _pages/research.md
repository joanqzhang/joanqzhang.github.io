## Phytoplankton trace metal requirements at different environmental conditions

Phytoplankton are organisms positioned at the bottom of the marine food chain and they are the basis of the marine ecosystems. The growth and distribution of marine phytoplankton are controlled by nutrients, including trace metals, present in the environment. These trace metals are co-factors of many enzymes that control carbon fixation, phosphorus uptake, and remineralisation. Therefore, their availability in the marine environment can regulate the growth and functions of phytoplankton, and even dictate the global rate of oceanic carbon export to the deep ocean. Key environmental factors such as temperature and light might influence trace metal requirements of different phytoplankton functional groups in the marine environment. Our group aims to get a comprehensive understanding of trace metal requirements of representative phytoplankton functional groups under different light intensities and temperatures, which vary across the global ocean, along water columns, and under climate change. We will identify the mechanisms that underpin phytoplankton trace metal requirements by proteomic analysis, and combine our experimental data with emerging global datasets of ocean trace metal content and genomics, to get a better view of the impacts of trace metal limitation on phytoplankton biogeographic distribution, ecological function, and contribution to carbon export.
